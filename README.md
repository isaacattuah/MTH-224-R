# MTH224-R
A compilation of R code implemented during my Introduction to Probability and Statistics Class. 

This course was instructed by Professor [Aleksandra Gorzycka-Sikora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aleksandra-gorzycka-sikora-14291a138)

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to probability and statistical inference. Topics include axioms of probability, counting techniques, discrete and continuous univariate and multivariate random variables, distributions, and applications of probability to statistical decisions (Central Limit Theorem, estimation, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing). Additionally, you will work with the R programming language to perform statistical analyses.

## Required Material 
[R](www.r-project.org) is a commonly used free Statistics software. It allows you to carry out statistical analyses in an interactive mode, as well as allowing simple programming.
